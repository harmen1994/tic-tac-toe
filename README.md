# tic-tac-toe

## Introduction

This is a simple tic-tac-toe game implemented in Svelte. It is a bot vs bot game.
The UI is implemented using Svelte and the game logic is implemented in TypeScript/JavaScript.
All TypeScript logic will be tested trough Vite tests, since we will use that in our upcoming project

## How it was set up

Since I want to reuse this documentation for future projects, I documented the setup process here.

```bash
